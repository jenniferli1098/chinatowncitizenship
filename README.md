Chinatown Citizenship is a website designed to create additional resources for Chinese immigrants to America to study for the US Citizenship interview alongside the PBHA Chinatown Citizenship program. It provides resources for two different topics: Basic English and US History. The students hoping to become a US Citizen will have to converse with an interviewer and answer many questions regarding US History. 

Thus, our English section provides 8 modules for students to learn different parts of conversational english, from numbers to commands to family. In each, there are flashcards that when hovered over, will flip to the Chinese translation of the front of the card. There are also review sections in English that can be translated into Chinese by hovering over it as well. Our English section also provides 2 exams for students to assess their knowledge. One is a randomized exam and the other is a matching game that allows for visual learning as well. In the matching game, one must match the English word with its respective image. 

Our US History section provides 8 modules for students to learn the US History required for the examination. There are also flashcards in each, and when hovered over, will flip to the answer to the possible question. There are also review sections in English that will go over important aspects of US History included in the Citizenship curriculum. When hovered over, the Chinese translation will be displayed. Additionally, there is audio included with the review. When “play” is clicked, the English in the review subsections will be read aloud, allowing for students to follow and familiarize themselves with hearing English. Finally, there is also a multiple choice exam.
